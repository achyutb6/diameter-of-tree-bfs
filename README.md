# diameter-of-tree-bfs

   Implement the algorithm to find the diameter of a tree using the
   algorithm discussed in class, that runs BFS twice.  Code this
   algorithm without modifying Graph.java and BFSOO.java, using them
   from package rbk.

   int diameter(Graph g) { ... }  // assume that g is an acyclic, connected graph (tree).
